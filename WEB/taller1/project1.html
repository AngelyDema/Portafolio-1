        <p>A melted problem</p>
        <p>In this project I worked with python and pygame to create a game called "A melted problem". The objective of the game is to help our caracther "penguin" to rescue their other friends captured by the humans. All the resources like desing of the caracthers, bakground, obstacles, animation and music were our own creation</p>
