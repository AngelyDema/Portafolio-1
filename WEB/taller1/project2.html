        <p>Habit tracker</p> // Added project title
        <p>Lianhua/Verdant Day Life is a habit tracker and to-do list application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The prototype currently includes a habit suggestion feature powered by an API with Gemini, offering users personalized recommendations to build healthier routines. The project is still in progress — the database configuration is planned to be implemented with Firebase, which will also be used for hosting.
        The initial prototype design was generated with AI, while the final version is planned to be more colorful and visually engaging. The frontend is built using Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, ensuring a clean, responsive, and modern user experience. </p>
