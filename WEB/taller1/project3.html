        <p>Phishing Training Camp</p>
        <p>This project aims to develop a web-based educational platform designed to help students from Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander recognize, understand, and prevent phishing attacks. The platform will provide resources, best practices, and interactive materials to raise awareness about cybersecurity threats. Although still in its initial stages, the project focuses on addressing the growing impact of phishing in Colombia and Latin America by fostering digital security skills among university students.</p>
